        "Transformer decoder models (such as LLaMa 3.1 and Mistral) are popular text-processing models.   \n",
        "One can distinguish two versions of such models: base and instruction-tuned.  \n",

        "In contrast, the instruction-tuned ones are base models that were additionally trained to follow instructions.  \n",
        "The text is presented to the transformer as a sequence of tokens.   \n",

        "To be more precise to convert text to tokens we first prepare a dictionary of common text fragments.   \n",
        "We usually want to have all possible letters in the dictionary so that all texts can be tokenized.   \n",
        "We then assign to each text piece from the dictionary an integer and use the dictionary to convert text into a sequence of tokens (integers).  \n",
        "The program that converts text into tokens is called a tokenizer.  \n",
